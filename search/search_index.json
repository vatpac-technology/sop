Usually the outbound aircraft will take the taxiway closest to the departure runway, and the vacating traffic will take the taxiway closest to the terminating end. For example - If RWY 23 is active, aircraft will enter at A4 and exit at A3 . If RWY 05 is active, aircraft will enter at A3 and exit at A4 . General Rules of Thumb RNP Approaches There are two RNP approaches per runway - the RNP Y or RNP Z. The RNP Y is used for Approach Category C or D aircraft (jet aircraft), whereas the RNP Z is to be used for Approach Category B aircraft, such as turboprops. Information The RNP Yankee and Zulu approaches follow the same lateral path, but have differing vertical paths. For example, on the go-around for the RNP -Z 23, there are speed restrictions placed on the initial climb fixes to QN737 . This forces the aircraft to gain altitude quicker. Departures Queenstown is surrounded by significant terrain, so aircraft should stick to the departure path where possible. However, once the aircraft has climbed above the surrounding terrain, they may be cleared direct to their SID termination fix, where they can resume their filed plan. Procedure Assignment RWY 23 STARs vatSys and EuroScope will usually assign the most appropriate arrival for that aircraft's flightplan. Arrival Direction Transition Fix STAR Notes NE ELRUV ELRUV 2A WN/CH traffic. AA traffic if using AAQN4 N DOVOT UBDAM 4B / DOVOT AA traffic, if using AAQN2 SE SUNGU SUNGU 4B NV traffic W ADKOS UBDAM 4B / ADKOS Oceanic traffic NW LIBLA UBDAM 4B / LIBLA Oceanic traffic Approaches All of Runway 23's STARs terminate at either UGPED or ATKIL , which are the IAF for both the RNP and back-up RNAV approaches. Category B aircraft should be given the RNP Z, and Category C/D aircraft should be given the RNP Y. Aircraft unable to fly the RNP approaches can be issued the RNAV G or H. These approaches follow the general path of the RNP approaches, albeit with a higher profile. Both of these approaches end in visual circling segments to both runways. Heads up! If you assign the RNAV G or H approaches to aircraft, you should expect them to not follow the visual segment. This significantly limits your runway occupancy, and increases the potential for conflict. Missed Approaches The Missed Approach for both RNPs have the aircraft climb to 10,000 feet and enter a hold at SUNGU . For aircraft unable to reach this altitude, they are to continue onwards to NV , climbing to 10,000 feet. Due to the holding point also being a STAR commencement fix, aircraft may be given a SUNGU based STAR for another attempt. Departures The assignment of departures out of Queenstown is largely governed by aircraft performance. This can be either climb performance, or navigation performance. Departures out of Queenstown that have a A or B suffix are RNP departure procedures. In this case, the entirety of the departure has lateral and vertical path to ensure separation from terrain. Departures that have a D , C , F , P , Q , S or T suffix is a RNAV departure, with a visual initial climb segment. Not all aircraft that fly into Queenstown are able to perform RNP procedures, so you may choose to issue a departure that is true to real life. On the network, in reality, most pilots aren't going to mind whether or not their departure is accurate - so the replication of that is up to you.

Tauranga Airport can accomodate up to an A320, but usually serves Air New Zealand's Turboprop fleet of ATR72 and Q300 aircraft. Tauranga also receives visits from the Air Chathams fleet of aircraft, serving as a fuel stop betwen mainland New Zealand and the Chatham Islands. Layout Tauranga Airport Has four gates on the main apron and is home to over 20 private hangars. Tauranga also hosts multiple flight training organisations, which provides training for fixed wing, helicopter and gliders. Tauranga Has six Runways in total. While only four are regularly used, the remainder are used when required or when special operations are in place. Runways Runway Designator Length (m) Type 07 - 25 1825 Bituminous 07 - 25 750 Grass 04 - 22 640 Grass 16 - 34 575 Grass Seal 07/25 is always issued to aircraft with a gross weight of 5500kg or more, and can be issued to smaller aircraft on request. Gliders & Helicopters are not permitted to use the sealed runway. Grass 25/07 is always issued to light aircraft with a gross weight of 5500kg or less and cannot be issued to Category B/C/D aircraft. Grass 04/22 Glider Operations Only The Airport Company has an agreement with the Gliding Club prohibiting use of Grass 04/22 for aircraft other than gliders and tow planes. Parallel Runway Operations Simultaneous parallel operations on sealed and grass runways 07/25 permitted only for aircraft 2300 kg or less in VFR conditions and when ATC is on duty. Use of Taxiways and Holding Points Taxiway E runs parallel to Grass 07/25, almost the entire length of the apron area. Upon Landing, Inbound aircraft will be told to either taxi to the apron or hold short of the grass due to departing/arriving traffic. If the latter has to occur, the aircraft must be instructed to taxi to A1/A2 and hold short of Grass 07/25. Grass Hold Short Points There are various intermediate holding points specifically for the Grass runways. Usually, these hold short points are located on hard-standing surfaces. Grass 07 - Golf Grass 25 - Foxtrot Grass 16 - W4 from the apron side, or W3 from the Sealed 07 threshold side. Sealed Hold Short Points Seal 07/25 (from the Main Apron) - A2 or A3 Seal 07 (light aircraft) - W1 or W2 Seal 25 (light aircraft) - E1 or E2 Info When Grass 04/22 is in use, aircraft using Taxiway W should hold short at W2 to prevent an incursion. General Rules of Thumb Movement Areas Aircraft should contact ATC before entering the movement area and should state their location after contact has been established. Aircraft who require taxi to the fuel pumps from any of the eastern hangars or Aero Club can do so without contacting ATC, provided they stay outside the Movement Area - as indicated by a dashed red line along Taxiway E. Parallel Operations If both the sealed and grass runways are occupied, and both aircraft are ready for departure, the aircraft on the grass runway should be instructed to takeoff first. This avoids the need to wait two or three minutes due to wake turbulence separation. The aircraft who departs first should be instructed to make an early turn to allow successive departure of the waiting aircraft. Crane Operation Danger Tauranga Port is Adjacent to Tauranga Airport and operates Multiple cranes up to 361 ft AMSL at 1.5 to 2.0 NM from Runway 07 Threshold. VFR Aircraft tracking Hunters Creek or Mt.

You don't need to have an in-depth knowledge of programming languages to contribute to the project, as most of our pages are written in Markdown . Everything else will be explained as we go. What are we looking for? On VATSIM, we have to draw the line between what's hyper-realistic and the practical limitations of the network. People use VATSIM for a wide range of reasons - some seek a realistic service, whereas some people might just want to add an extra dimension to an already enjoyable hobby. When contributing to these SOPs , it's important to keep this in mind and to cater to everybody on the network. We draw the line at things like low-visibilty and noise-abatement operations - where there offer no real benefit in the virtual environment. In contrast, procedures for Code F aircraft should be added, as these can have an effect on Pilots and their aircraft. Before you dig in. It's important that you read all of the Contribution documentation before making any changes. These will ensure that your PR 's are approved and merged quickly. Additionally, we ask that you reach out to the Operations Team before opening a new PR for your addition. This ensures that this is a welcome feature to the project. There is a channel on the VATNZ Discord dedicated to the discussion and management of these SOPs , which is not open by default to the Community. If you wish to be added to this channel, please contact the Operations Team, and they'll add you.","title":"Let's help out!"},{"location":"assist-us/docs/#what-are-we-looking-for","text":"On VATSIM, we have to draw the line between what's hyper-realistic and the practical limitations of the network.

This page should give you an indication of how to properly set up an individual page or category. We'll go through the motions of setting up a new category, which will take you through most of the things needed. Starting a new Category or subdirectory Let's say we want to create a new 'Military' category, here's the category setup we'd want: Main Directory / docs/ military / .pages index.md buzzandbreak.md formationflying.md .pages Within the main docs/ directory, create the new folder. The name of the folder will also be what's shown in the URL string - in this case it'll be website.xyz/military/ . Within that directory, you can see a few files. The files ending in .md are singular pages and follow the normal page conventions. The .pages file is a MkDocs specific file that tells MkDocs how to render the navigation elements. We'll touch base on that later. Single Page Every page starts the same way - with a title declaration and an abbreviation include. --- title: Building Blocks --- --8<-- \"includes/abbreviations.md\" The title declaration block is sets the title across a few different areas. It automatically appears at the top of the page as an h1 element, and will show in all website navigation unless overwritten by a .pages file. The --8<-- \"includes/abbreviations.md\" line pulls in the abbreviations file. This pulls in defined abbreviations, and allows for these to be shown all across the site. Hint Since the title attribute can be seen across multiple areas, so it's important that it's both short and descriptive. If the page is nested within another category, you should be able to rely on context. For example, this page is called Building Blocks . This could mean Lego, but since it's in the Assist Us section, you would be fair to assume that it contains the building blocks of a page. .pages file As eluded to before, the .pages file is a tells MkDocs how to render the navigation elements. title: Military nav: - \"Overview\": index.md - \"Buzz and Break\": buzzandbreak.md - formationflying.md - ... The title property dictates how the military/ directory is named in navigation. In this particular example, the directory is military/ , but is defined as title: Military . This doesn't change how the category is processed, only displayed. Breakdown: nav: - Dictates how items are shown, and in what order. This is mandatory. \"Overview\": index.md - \"Overview\" is a manually set title, and overrides any titles defined locally within the page itself. For the index.md page, this is shown as the index page for the directory it sits in. Once rendered, this page sits at website.xyz/military/ . \"Buzz and Break\": buzzandbreak.md - Same as above, but this file sits at website.xyz/military/buzzandbreak/ . formationflying.md - In this case, this file has a title defined within the file itself. This would be inherited into the navigation. ... - This means that all other files within the directory will be shown in alphabetical order.

When your working on these SOPs , we require you to create a new branch, that we can then merge into main . So how do we contribute a new item or section? Let's have a look! Fork the project into your personal account on GitHub. Create a new branch from main , with a clear name of what you're implementing - seen in the image on the right. Checkout your new branch, and commit some changes. Open a new Pull Request for your changes/branch. This can be done by heading to the sops repository, and finding Pull requests Click on the green button, saying New pull request Make note of the arrow! In the image to the left, you can see that the arrow shows that we're wanting to merge this-is-a-test-branch into main . After making sure the arrows are correct, click on the green Create pull request button. Make sure your title clearly explains the changes you've made, but is still concise. Fill out the main content of your PR as necessary. The main content of your PR serves as the project tracker for that feature or fix. Feel free to add in checkboxes of important steps, or whatever you need. Other people are also able to make changes to your branch, and may occasionally have some discussion on your PR . Once you're happy, smash the green Create pull request button!","title":"Making your Changes"},{"location":"assist-us/docs/setup/","text":"We'll kick off by setting up your local development environment. Important If you have any questions about setting up your development environment for these SOPs , or you get stuck - feel free to reach out to the Operations Team. Requirements To contribute, you'll need the following - A basic code editor or IDE. We recommend VS Code with a Markdown helper plugin. A GitHub account, and a local Git environment - GitHub Quickstart Guide . Python - Install Python Lets get cracking! Fork and Clone the - SOPs Project - Guide . Install the following Python packages: mkdocs-material, mkdocs-git-revision-date-localized-plugin, mkdocs-awesome-pages-plugin and mkdocs-redirects . Easy Python Package Installation These packages can be installed easily through a single command. pip install - r requirements . txt You'll still need to ensure you have Python installed first, as these use pip - a Python package installer. Once you've installed the requirements, open a command line terminal, cd into the cloned repository and start the mkdocs service: mkdocs serve You'll see the command line performing some magic, eventually displaying Serving on http://127.0.0.1:8000 .

Links Links that navigate a user through the SOPs site can follow the normal Markdown syntax. All links that navigate a user away from the SOPs site should have {target=new} appended - this opens the link in a new tab. Internal Link External Link [ Internal Link ]( enroute.md ) [ External Link ]( https://vatnz.net ){target=new} Warning All external links should use the https protocol. Buttons Buttons should be used sparingly, if at all. Inline text hyperlinks are the preferred method of user interaction. Images If context needs to be added, then an image is the way to go - particularly if a complex process is being described, or you're illustrating a difference. Images also use the default markdown syntax, but can have some additional properties added, similar to links. These are: align=left or align=right : Does what it says on the tin - applies a float to the image either to the left or right. width=\"xxx\" : Changes the width of an image, where xxx is the width in pixels. You can also add multiple properties together, with a space between the attributes. Image Captions Where confusion can arise from the placement or relevance of an image, you can opt to use a caption.

Requirements The SFG app should run on any PC running Windows 7, 10 or 11. The system must have at least .Net Framework 4 installed. Prior to installing the SFG app, you will need to set up the following: XAMPP - XAMPP is an Apache distribution that contains a MySQL server, replicating a live server on your local machine. GitHub Desktop - Needed in order to manage the EuroScope releases, vatSys Datasets and database. When setting up XAMPP and MySQL, you have the option to set a username and password for the root user. If you set your own, you're able to set this under Export > User Options . Updating of the Database Local Repository The SFG has the ability to import an updated version of the SFG database from a GitHub repository, as well as the ability to export the database ready for committal to the AIS Data Manager repo. This feature requires you to set the mysqld.exe locations in the User Options dialog, found on the Export page. These can typically be found in your XAMPP install directory under xampp\\mysql\\bin .

For the Pacific dataset, the primary source is a locally stored copy of the Navigraph database. The ANR data released by Airways is on a 56-day release schedule, usually meaning that the Dataset will vary between a minor and major release every cycle. Minor releases are releases where the ANR has not been updated, and is usually a great time to implement new features or positions or fix errors in the dataset. Major releases are releases where the ANR has been updated, and usually requires a significant rework of locally defined procedures within the dataset. Updating the ANR Data There are two methods of updating the ANR data - automatic and manual. The automatic mode will download the ANR from the AIP website, convert them from PDF to text, before running them against regex patterns to process and import them into the database. Automated Updates The automatic ANR update will download the latest documents from the AIP website, convert them from PDF to Text, before running them against various regex patterns to process and import them into various database tables. To perform an automatic update, navigate to the DB Update tab and click on Extract and Import all eAIP Data . You should now see the progress bar, alongside the file currently being worked. Important It is normal to see various errors during the import process, particularly with the Aerodrome and Airways imports. The SFG will notify you of errors as they occur - so make a note. The error prompt will also notify you of the suggested fix. You will most likely encounter an error when importing the Part 95 Routes file, which contains all airways for both NZZC and NZZO. The error prompt will alert you to the specific Type, Identifier and Sequence that is producing the error. This will require you to manually review and fix the faulting sequence(s). You will then be required to import the amended file through the manual import process. Manual Updates The Manual ANR updates are a little bit more involved. You should never really have to perform these, unless you are given an advance copy of the ANR / AIP by the publisher. Updating the database manually requires you to convert the documents from PDF to Text using the function in the Utilities tab, before importing them in the DB Update tab. The table below identifies which imports to use for the various files. Required Import Button Files Airports Aerodrome Coordinates Airspace Common Frequency Zone (CFZ) Controlled Airspace (CTA) Controlled Airspace (CTR) Controlled Airspace (OCA) Danger Areas (D) Flight Information Regions ( FIR ) Mandatory Broadcast Zones (MBZ) Military Operating Areas (MOA) Restricted Areas (R) Holding (Enroute) VFR Fixes Visual Reporting Points ( VRPs ) IFR Fixes Designated Points (ICAO) Navaids Navaids Airways Routes Not Used General Aviation Areas (GAA) Low Flying Zones (LFZ) Mountainous Zones (NZMZ) Parachute Landing Areas (PLA) Transit Lanes (T) Volcanic Hazard Zones (VHZ) Right Hand Circuits Updating the Pacific data Due to the Pacific having multiple data sources, it is easier to pull from the Navigraph data. This unfortunately means that the data is always a cycle behind, but it is preferential against having to go digging through the French AIP . To achieve this, the SFG will find the locally stored vatSys copy of the Navigraph data, and will import that depending on various checks. Automatic Update Information As the SFG pulls from the vatSys copy of Navigraph data, you will need to make sure you have the latest version. This can be done by opening vatSys and navigating to Settings > Navigraph > Check for Updates . To perform an automatic update, navigate to the DB Update tab and click on Import Pacific Data . You should now see the progress bar, alongside the file currently being worked. How the data is processed The Pacific data imported, as well as some of the exported data, is filtered by two boundaries defined in AIRAC Testing/SFG Data/NZZC NZZO Check Boundaries.xml . The NZZO Check Boundary is the boundary of the NZZO, NTTT and TSN sectors. Only data that exists within these boundaries are imported from the Navigraph data. The NZZC Check Boundary is a boundary 4nm inside the actual NZZC FIR boundary. This is used during the export process to specifically exclude some of the data from being produced the in the Pacific dataset, such as airways and fixes inside the NZZC.

This is incredibly handy for having different Enroute Sectors export definitions for vatSpy versus vatSys, for example. Database Overview Draw definitions follow the standard NZ eAIP method of drawing airspace, as used in the ANR . All airspace definitions are stored in the airspace table of the database. The important columns are - id - Automatically generated on import. ident - The identifier of that airspace. This is explained below. VSName , Comment - Contains the name of the airspace. Type - Airspace Type. This is explained below. ExportID - Dictates which product this airspace is exported to. This is explained below. Unique Airspace Identifiers All airspace imported into the database must have a unique ident . Airspace imported from the ANR will have their airspace designator set as the ident , so should be unique by default. It is best practice to have the Sector set as the ident , as it is easily distinguishable, without having to manually test it. Imported airspace identifiers must fit the following criteria - Enroute : NXXX , with an optional _X or -X where X can be alphanumeric. Manual FIR : NXXX , with an optional _X or -X where X can be alphanumeric. TMA : NZTnnn , with an optional _X or -X where X can be alphanumeric. where nnn is a unique sequence number. Airspace Types There are a handful of different airspace types in the database. The CFZ , MBZ , CTA , CTR , FIR , Military , Danger and Restricted areas are automatically labelled by the ANR import process. The only user configurable airspace types are ENR , MFIR and TMA . Airspace imported as ENR , MFIR or TMA will be exported to the dataset in line with the ExportID. The ENR type will be exported as an Enroute map, MFIR as a FIR map, and TMA as a TMA map. Export IDs The SFG is capable of storing multiple unique airspace definitions, and exporting them to multiple differing platforms. This is achieved through the ExportID column. Each piece of airspace is tagged with one of the following ExportID , dictating which products it is exported to - NZZC - Exported to both vatSys/ES and vatSpy VSPY - Exported only to vatSpy VSYS - Exported only to vatSys/ES NZZCVSYS - Exported only to the NZZC vatSys/ES release NZZO - Exported to the Oceanic profile and vatSpy NZZOVSYS - Exported only to the Oceanic vatSys profile NZZCNZZO - Exported to both vatSys/ES profiles, and to vatSpy. Airspace imported from the NZ ANR are automatically labelled with the NZZC ExportID. If an export ID isn't provided in the Import Limits Line, it is imported as NZZC . Format Overview Each file has a header line defining the type of airspace, before a name and limits line. The header line will be covered in the examples, as they're self explanatory. Limits Line The Name and Limits Line defines how this is represented in the database. Limits Line [Ident] [Type] [Airspace Class] [UpperLimit] [LowerLimit] [Optional Export Tag] For example - NZCT Taranaki Only ENR C 99900 FT 0 FT VSYS NZCT-A Taranaki with Ohakea ENR C 99900 FT 0 FT VSPY NTTT Tahiti Oceanic FIR FIR 999 FL NSFA Faleolo FIR FIR 999 FL Ident - As referenced in the Unique Airspace Identifiers section. Type - TMA , ENR or MFIR. Airspace Class - A, C or D. UpperLimit - Upper Limit in either FT or FL. EG 0 FT, 3500 FT, 130 FL. MFIR only has an upper limit. LowerLimit - Lower Limit. As above. Export Tag - As above. Boundary Lines Boundary Lines are defined immediately after the Name and Limits line. Boundary Lines [Ident] [SequenceNum] [Lattitude] [Longitude] [LineType] [ArcDef] For example - NZT001 5 403753.80S 1745231.60E GRC NZT001 6 394745.20S 1744603.20E CWA 401234.58S 1752331.05E 38.00 NM Ident - Must match the ident used in the Name and Limits Line. SequenceNum - A unique line identifier. Starts at 0. Lattitude - Lattitude in eAIP format. Longitude - Longitude in eAIP format. LineType - Either GRC , CCA , CIR , CWA , RHL or FNT . ArcDef - As needed to define an arc or circle. Examples Here are some examples that are currently in our database.

The Procedure Editor covers the following procedures - SIDs STARs VFR arrivals and departures Helicopter-specifc procedures (not used) Approaches ( RNP , RNP -AR, LOC and VOR) How does it work? The ProcEd allows the user to create procedures for any of the aerodromes contained within the contl_apt or uncontl_apt tables. Aerodromes not appearing in either of these two tables will not be able to have procedures created for them - regardless of whether or not they appear in other tables, such as ap_aids . After an aerodrome has been added to either of the required tables, it will show under the Airport ICAO dropdown when New Procedure is clicked. The app will automatically pull in the aerodrome's runways, as listed in the runway table. For procedures that have transitions ( SIDs , STARs and approaches), you are required to add the base procedure, and then the various transition routings. This is further defined in the various procedure sections. What happens on export? On export, the ProcEd largely performs the same actions for both the vatSys and EuroScope releases, but performs and exports them slightly differently. vatSys Each Aerodrome in the contl_apt and uncontl_apt tables are given their own Map folder within the Maps dropdown. The file name XX_ACU is dictated by the icaoabbrv in the relevant table. All of the SIDs , STARs and approaches are rendered on their own map layer, sorted by runway. RNP and RNP -AR approaches are given their own map layers, also sorted by runway. These are also given custom colours, but these are better explained in the individual procedure sections. All VFR arrivals and departures are also given their own map layer, independent of the VRP map layer. Euroscope All procedure layers are rendered into the SIDSTAR section, and are sortable by ICAO. VFR procedures are also rendered in this section. Threshold Fixes In the dataset, custom fixes have been created for each threshold of a runway. These are generated from the runway data provided by the ANR , and don't require any manual attention by the user. They usually follow the format of XXYYT - where XX is the two letter ICAO abbreviation, YY is the runway identifier, and T denotes the threshold. For example, PM07T and PM25T denote the thresholds for Palmerston North's single runway. Where a runway has a R/L designation, the designator will replace the T . For example, AA23L and AA05R denote the thresholds for Auckland. These are mostly used in SIDs , where an origination point is required.

Changing the Name will update all transitions for that procedure. Changing the Number will update all alphas and transitions for that procedure. Changing the Alpha will update all transitions for that procedure. Changing the Transition will update only the selected procedure. The aircraft type box will alter what aircraft this SID can be made available to in the vatSys FDRs. Ticking the Radar SID box will make the SID the default for non- RNP / RNAV aircraft.

You can add a SID for either a single runway, or all runways at an aerodrome. Where a procedure might be for multiple but not all runways, you should select all. Tip When adding a procedure that has various transitions, you are required to add the base procedure first. This is the part of the procedure that is common to all of the transitions. Usually on charts, this is solid line portion of the procedure. Subsequent transitions can be added by adding a new procedure, entering the base procedure, and then adding the desired transition fix in the Transition box. Clicking Add SID will open to the main screen, where you can add the transition route to the right hand text box. Tip You can also add custom coordinates to create a custom path, or a manual turning point. This is often used for a 500ft turn point, as can be seen in the above illustration of the ECHO5 procedure out of Palmerston North. You can create this point by looking at the procedure in LittleNavMap, displaying the procedure and placing a custom waypoint where the turn commences. This coordinate can then be converted in the SFG 's DMS Conv utility to the SCT format, and can be added like any other fix. The example above shows the RUXOX4S for Runway 07 at Palmerston North. The PM25T and PM07T fixes are threshold fixes. Normally the opposite end threshold fix is not required, but has been added here, as VEPUR is slightly offset from the runway centreline. RUXOX is the final common fix for the procedure. Waypoints OLMUX , OH VOR and RUGVI make up the rest of the transition, and are entered in the order that they are flown.

The PM25T and PM07T fixes are threshold fixes. Normally the opposite end threshold fix is not required, but has been added here, as VEPUR is slightly offset from the runway centreline. RUXOX is the final common fix for the procedure. Waypoints OLMUX , OH VOR and RUGVI make up the rest of the transition, and are entered in the order that they are flown. The circle next to OH VOR designated that it is a ground-based navigation aid, not an IFR waypoint. VOR/DMEs and NDBs all show as a circle.

Tip Further information can be found in ENR 1.6 - 5, \"ATS Surveillance Services and Procedures\" . VFR Traffic Typically aircraft that are flying under VFR do not transmit a discrete code; instead transmitting a generic type code. There are a few exceptions, such as when they are operating within a controlled aerodrome circuit or are required to be controlled due to manoeuvreing within a Control Zone. Code Range Description 0300 - 0377 Discrete Code range for Controlled VFR aircraft. 1200 Generic code for VFR fixed wing aircraft, when a discrete code has not been issued. 1300 Generic code for gliders and balloons. 1500 Generic code for a VFR helicopter when a discrete code has not been issued. 2200 VFR aircraft operating within a Controlled Aerodrome circuit. 3000 - 3777 Discrete code range for Controlled VFR aircraft. 4000 - 4777 Discrete code range for Controlled VFR aircraft. Tip Discrete squawk codes can be issued to VFR aircraft when operating within a Control Zone. For example, if a Cessna is leaving the zone via the Mangere Bridge departure at Auckland, they can be given a squawk code of 3214 to aid in discrete identification within the TMA . When they leave the control zone, they can keep the discrete code or change to the respective generic code. Aircraft remaining within a Controlled Aerodrome's circuit should squawk 2200. This aids in easy distinction between generic traffic and circuit traffic. Domestic IFR All IFR traffic within the New Zealand FIR is required to transmit a discrete squawk code. This is required to ensure that all traffic can be individually identified on the Controller's radar scope. Code Range Description 2000 Generic code for IFR aircraft not actively managed by an ATC unit. 5000 - 5777 Discrete code range for Domestic IFR aircraft Codes shall be issued to an aircraft during the Clearance Delivery process, and transmitted throughout the duration of their flight. International IFR Traffic All IFR traffic with their destination outside of the New Zealand Domestic FIR are required to transmit a discrete squawk code within the International IFR range. This is required to ensure that all traffic can be individually identified on the Controller's radar scope. Code Range Description 0100 - 0177 Reserve code range for International IFR aircraft. This code range may only be used during high traffic events as authorised by the Events Director, or Operations Director. 0200 - 0277 Discrete code range for International IFR aircraft. 2000 Generic code for IFR aircraft not actively managed by an ATC unit. Codes shall be issued to an aircraft during the Clearance Delivery process, and transmitted throughout the duration of their flight. Tip In the event that aircraft entering the Domestic FIR already has a discrete code issued by an international Controller, that code may be kept. For example - If a Qantas 737 enters the Domestic FIR squawking 1221, which is a discrete code within the Australian international range, they may keep their code provided that no other aircraft has that squawk code. If their code is not unique, then they must be given a unique code before instructions can be given to that aircraft. Military Traffic Code Range Description 6000 - 6477 Discrete code range for Military fixed wing aircraft. 6500 - 6577 Discrete code range for Military helicopters. Military aircraft shall be assigned a discrete code regardless of flight profile. This code shall be assigned when either a VFR or IFR clearance is issued. Military traffic remaining within a controlled aerodrome's circuit should continue to squawk their discrete military code. All foreign military aircraft with their flight originating within New Zealand should also be assigned a code within the military range. If the FMA is crossing into the New Zealand FIR , it is up to the Controller's discretion whether to assign a military squawk or not. Tip Military traffic is relatively common on VATSIM. Because of this, Controllers should familiarize themselves with routinely used callsigns, which can be found under Controller Skills . Formation Flights Unless otherwise instructed by ATC, only the leader is to squawk NORMAL, and all other aircraft are to squawk STANDBY. Military Aircraft Military aircraft formations will be issued a 'base squawk' for the formation flight, with the last number corresponding to the aircraft's formation number.

NZZO-E's area of responsibility is East of the International Date Line. Other real-world Sectors The protrusion at the top of the NZZO FIR actually has three subsectors defined by Airways - the Samoan, Tongan and Cook Sectors. These subsectors are only activated when there is significant traffic in the area that one Oceanic Controller is unable to manage. Even then, they use the same callsign and primary frequency (8.867) as NZZO. Traffic levels on VATSIM rarely get this high, so this split is not warranted.

Fua'Amotu would hand aircraft off to NZZO_FSS upon crossing the boundary. Why is their callsign Tower, not Approach? We've had to implement this position with a _APP suffix, as the FSD restricts _TWR callsigns to a visibility range of 50nm. Towers None! NFTF_TWR is covered by NFTF_APP.

Niue Positions (NI**) Niue only has a Flight Information Service, providing only traffic information. This will be modelled as NIUE_TWR , with a standard Tower visibility range of 50nm. The Tower is to provide a traffic information service, in addition to relaying IFR clearances from NZZO_FSS. Departing Departing aircraft should make contact with NZZO_FSS upon passing 20DME from NU . If unable to gain contact, they are to remain with NIUE_TWR until they have positive contact. Arriving Arriving aircraft will be given clearance to leave Controlled Airspace on descent through FL245, however should maintain a listening watch on NZZO_FSS. Aircraft should attempt to make contact with NIUE_TWR around 40 DME, and shall report that positive contact to NZZO_FSS before dropping that frequency. NIUE_TWR will report your landing back to NZZO_FSS in order to close your flightplan. Samoa Positions (NS**) This section covers both Western Samoa and American Samoa. Enroute There are no real-world Enroute Sectors operating above Samoa, however due to Samoa's complex Approach sectors and large TMAs, we merge them into a single Faleolo Control Sector. NSFA_CTR : \"Faleolo Control\" on 126.900. Limits : Vertical limits differ. Includes the main sector to the West, and the 'R' sector over Pago Pago. The West Sector is from SFC to FL245. The East Sector is from 3,500ft to FL245. The West Sector provides an Enroute Service for NSFA, and interfaces directly with NSFA. The East Sector provides a TMA service to NSTU, but does not provide a Tower service, as the lower limit is 3,500ft. Tower NSFA_TWR \"Faleolo Tower\" on 118.100 Limits : SFC to 7,500ft. Lateral bounds as shown above. Provides a Procedural Approach service for NSFA. Also provides a control service for NSMA to the west. NSTU NSTU (Pago Pago) is an interesting aerodrome. It is normally uncontrolled, with a combined App/Dep above it, starting at 3,500ft. On the network, this service is to be provided by NSFA_CTR. A tower position will be established on the network for NSTU, as an Event Only position on 122.900. While not incredibly accurate, it will be helpful when an event in underway in the area. The NSTU Clearance position will not be modelled. Cook Islands (NC**) Cook Islands airspace covers a substantial area, which unfortunately cannot be modelled with complete accuracy on the network.

Provides a Class E IFR and Traffic service to aircraft above FL045, outside of any other CTA airspace such as Tower/Approach/Enroute. Enroute NTTT_CTR : \"Tahiti Control\" on 134.700 Provides a radar service within the Iles Sous Le Vent sector from 1500ft to FL195. Provices a procedural service outside of the Iles Sous Le Vent sector, up to 200nm DME TAF, from FL045 to F195. This 200nm diameter circle is Class E, where an IFR service is provided, and only a VFR traffic information service is provided. Provides an Enroute/Approach Control service for flights between NTTB (Bora Bora), NTTR (Raiatea), Huahine (NTTH) and Tupai (NTUU). NTTB and NTTR have their own Towers, operating from SFC to 1,500ft. NTTB_TWR also covers NTUU to the north. NTTH is uncontrolled, with the base of NTTT_CTR at 1,500ft. The outer-most ring is the 200nm ring. Inside of this, the Class E service is provided by NTTT_CTR - outside it is provided by NTTT_FSS. TMA NTAA_APP : \"Tahiti Approach\" on 121.300 A 50nm radius circle centered on NTAA, with a wedge missing from the SE due to the big ass mountain. Provides a service from 2,500ft to FL195. Towers NTAA_TWR : \"Tahiti Tower\" on 118.100 Limits: SFC to 2,500ft. Essentially a 20nm circle centered on TAF VOR, with two wedges cut out over mainland Tahiti and the island of Moorea. NTAA provides a ground service on 121.900. Moorea Tower (NTTM) is 10nm North West of NTAA, with a small control zone from SFC to 1,500ft. This zone sits inside of NTAA_TWR's airspace, and the Tower function is provided by NTAA when NTTM is off watch. NTTM_TWR : \"Moorea Tower\" on 118.700 Limits : SFC to 1,500ft. Basically a square that sits over the North side of Moorea. Eastern lateral bound is roughly 5nm east of Moorea, and 10 miles to the North and West. The NTTM control zone sits entirely within NTAA_TWR's zone. When NTTM_TWR is off watch, the Tower function is provided by NTAA_TWR. The Approach service is still provided by NTAA_APP from 1,500ft. NTAA_APP does not perform top-down services to NTTM_TWR. Care needs to be taken surrounding the assignment of SIDs / STARs at Moorea, as the extended centerline for RWY 12/30 interfaces with RWY 04/22 at NTAA. Traffic at NTAA has priority . NTTB_TWR : \"Bora Bora Tower\" on 118.900 Limits : SFC to 1,500ft. Bora Bora Tower's CTR is essentially a 15nm by 10nm box centered on BB NDB, with the long axis running NW to SE. There is a small wedge to the south of the AD, with the LL raised to 500ft. The Tower CTR sits within NTTT_CTR, and can expect the Approach and Enroute service to be provided by NTTT_CTR. TODO : Investigate behaviour between NTTB and NTUU, as NTUU sits within NTTB's CTR. NTTR_TWR : \"Raiatea Tower\" on 118.500 Limits : SFC to 1,500ft. The Raiatea CTR is a weird bow-tie looking CTR, interfacing with Bora Bora's CTR to the NW, and extending out to the East by about 10nm. The top and bottom wedges are due to Fareura/Puurauti to the North, and Tefatoaiti to the South. AFIS About Flight Information Services Flight Information Services provide a traffic advisory and weather information service. They also relay IFR clearances to aircraft on behalf of their senior sector. These stations are not a priority, and are simply \"nice to have\" positions that would be cool to feature in an event.
